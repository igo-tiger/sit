==Info:
Main page for guest "http://localhost:3000/issues"
Main page for staff "http://localhost:3000/staff" (login as igo/igo or abc/abc)
Page for users edit "http://localhost:3000/users"



==What I could to do but time out:
-send mail (Notifier.issue_new(@issue).deliver)
-design (design added only to main page "staff#index" based on jquery-ui)



==Questions:

1)erb to haml for form (ex. from app\views\users\haml\_form.html.haml - translate several files and backup there because form not work properly)
***
- form_for(@user) do |f|
  .field
    = f.label :name
    %br
    = f.text_field :name
***
as a result - form is not shown..why?

2)sha2 (ex. from app\controllers\issues_controller.rb)
#I was try this:
A --- session[:ref] = Digest::SHA2.hexdigest(Time.now.to_s + 'ts')
#but it seems that it's not pure string, so I try this:
B --- session[:ref] = session[:session_id]
#A not working, B work in next use:
@issue = Issue.new(params[:issue])
@issue.ref = session[:ref]
@issue.save
@issues = Issue.where(:ref=>session[:ref])

3)select_tag (ex. from app\views\staff\show.html.erb)
***model
class Issue < ActiveRecord::Base
  STATUS_LIST = ['?', 'Waiting for Staff Response', 'Waiting for Customer', 'On Hold', 'Cancelled', 'Completed']
***view
<%= select_tag :status, Issue::STATUS_LIST %>
***
why not work?
